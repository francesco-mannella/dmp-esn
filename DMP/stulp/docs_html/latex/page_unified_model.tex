Whilst coding this library and numerous discussion with Olivier Sigaud, it became apparent that the latent function representations of all the function approximators in this library all use the same generic model.

Each specific model (i.\+e. as used in G\+P\+R, G\+M\+R, L\+W\+R, etc.) is a special case of the Unified Model. We discuss this in a forthcoming paper titled\+: \char`\"{}\+Many Regression Algorithms, One Unified Model -\/ A Review, Freek Stulp and Olivier Sigaud\char`\"{}, which you should be able to find in an on-\/line search.
